It was determined that Pareto optimization uses the relation
Pareto dominance, which favors one object over
other only "in the case when the first object is no worse in all criteria
the second and at least one of them is better. If this condition is true
the first object is considered dominant, and the second - dominated. Two
object for which the preference for at least one criterion
diverges are considered incomparable.
